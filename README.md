# Assignment 1
This assignment contains code that takes approx 6 hours to run. Only run it if **absolutely** necessary.</br>

The purpose of this assignment is to use the dataset of 70,000 image files and use it to compare 3 classification algorithms.</br>
It also uses cross-validation for each of these algorithms to find the absolutely best values.</br>
The classification algorithms used are:
- SVM
- Logisitical Regression
- K Nearest Neighbour
- Random Forest

Included in the file is the outputs of each code cell which shows the values for both the algorithms and the cross validation scores along with graphs that visualize this data.
